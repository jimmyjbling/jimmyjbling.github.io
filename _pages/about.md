I am a 2nd year PhD student in the pharmaceutical science program at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://pharmacy.unc.edu/education/phd/) advised by [Prof Alexander Tropsha](https://pharmacy.unc.edu/directory/tropsha/)

My research broadly focus on devolping and applying machiene learning and artificial intelligence methodologies for early stage structual based drug design. More specificially, I am intrested in understanding weak points and limitations in both the use of these computational methods and the data used to construct them in order to make these methods more robust and useful to non-computational researchers.

Outside of work I am avid sewer of costumes for my goose, Goose Springsteen
