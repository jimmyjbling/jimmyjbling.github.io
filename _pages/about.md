I am a 3rd year PhD student in the pharmaceutical science program at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://pharmacy.unc.edu/education/phd/) co-advised by 
[Prof Alexander Tropsha](https://pharmacy.unc.edu/directory/tropsha/) and [Prof Konstantin Popov](https://pharmacy.unc.edu/directory/kpopov/)

My research broadly focuses on developing and applying machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies for 
early-stage structural based drug discovery, specifically in regard to high-throughput virtual screening.
More recently,
I have been focusing on methods
for leveraging ML alongside DNA Encoded Libraries to assist with rapid early stage discovery.
My focus is split into three areas, development of novel methodologies, applying said methods in tangible discovery 
campaigns alongside wet lab collaborators,
and devolping more rigorous in-silico validation methods
to better assess the quality and risk of utilizing a given ML model.

Outside of work, I am an avid sewer of costumes for my goose, Goose Springsteen, and like to read about herpetology (frogs).
