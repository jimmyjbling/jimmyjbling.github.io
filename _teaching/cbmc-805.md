Teaching assistant for introduction class on molecular modeling, 2022 and 2023

Overview
======
Ran the lab section of the class, developing and revamping the syllabus and content covered in the lab along with creating an application focus final project assignment.
This required the development of new code and packages for the class, as students are not expected to have nor are taught programing in this course, instead focusing on how appropriately utilize available tools to answer questions computationally.
